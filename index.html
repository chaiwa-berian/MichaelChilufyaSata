          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p class="lead">The fifth Zambian president, former Governor Michael Chilufya Sata, took his oath of office on September 23, 2011, after leading his political party for 10 years. He died in London on October 28, 2014, leaving Vice President Guy Scott as Acting President
            until a presidential by-election was held on 20 January 2015. President Sata served as the embodiment of perseverance, determination, ambition, vision, compassion, hard work, honesty, charisma, forthrightness and selflessness. He is one person through
            whom Zambians can mirror themselves in their quest to attain a virtuous society!
          </p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead">
            Mr Sata's legacy stands as a perfect example of a man and whose life the future generations can learn from. Through his life and works, Zambia can guide herself on a road to equity, social justice and economic advancement. A Michael Chilufya Sata biography
            can be a reference point for shaping the thinking and attitudes of many Zambians, now and in the future. As a society, we can use our own Michael Chilufya Sata to teach children in primary and secondary schools the virtues of hard work and good
            citizenship.
